      You can think of elements as containers for content. The opening and
      closing tags tell the browser what content the element contains. The
      browser can then use that information to determine how it should interpret
      and format the content.

        of the image if it cannot be loaded. It is also used with screen readers
        to describe what the image is to visually impaired users.
