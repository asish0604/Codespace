      "This entire recipe is cheaper than one bowl at Olive Garden," culinary
      producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom) says of this pasta fagioli
      recipe. Here are a few of her best tips and tricks for making a perfect
      pot of Italian soup every time:
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the recipe calls for one can of chicken broth, Nicole uses more
      because she prefers her pasta fagioli a little more soupy. · Many pasta
      fagioli recipes call for Italian sausage. You can add the meat if you
      like, but this top-rated recipe is pretty hearty as-is. · To serve, Nicole
      likes to ladle the soup into bowls and top with freshly grated Parmesan,
      cracked black pepper, and fresh parsley.
